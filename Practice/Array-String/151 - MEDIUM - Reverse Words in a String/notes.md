# Pseudo Code

iterate through the length of the string

build a word in a new string until you reach an empty space in the given string

add this string to a dictionary with a numeric index in order from 0 to n

save the number of words in a variable n

begin adding the next word when you reach a new non space character and repeat until finished

navigate through the dictionary by numeric key in reverse from n to 0, creating a new string with only one space between each word.


# Notes


Seems that Medium array strings can often be solved by creative dictionary use
