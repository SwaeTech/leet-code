# Pointers

The technique uses two pointers, often called the "slow" and "fast" pointers, that move through the data structure at different speeds. The slow pointer usually moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves more quickly. 

# Traversal

The pointers can traverse the array from both ends or at different speeds. For example, one pointer can start at the first index and the other pointer can start at the last index. 

# Problem solving

The technique is often used to solve problems more efficiently than using a single pointer or nested loops. For example, it can be used to find pairs in a sorted array that add up to a specific target. 

# Time complexity

The time complexity of the two-pointer technique is O(n^2), where n is the length of an array.
