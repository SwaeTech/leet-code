- Understand the smallest example
- Struggle is part of the learning process (struggle in the time you have, but don't leave without a solution)
- Follow the naive approach with pseudo code, then real code, then try to optimize it
- Use std out (console.log) if available to debug. it's a standard method for debugging javascript code.
- look at problems, backwards, forwards, and sideways (especiclly when it comes to Arrays)
- Get good at hypothetical inputs for edge case considerations
