# Exactly! ðŸŒŸ When you call the dfs function, each call is added to the call stack. 
# The traversal list is updated with each node as you go deeper. Since traversal is
# a reference to the same list across all function calls, it retains all the nodes
# added, even as functions complete and are popped off the stack. T
# his way, you end up with a complete traversal of the tree! Keep exploring! ðŸš€
