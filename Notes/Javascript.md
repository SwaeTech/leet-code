# Strings

In JavaScript, strings areÂ immutable, which means the best you can do is to create a new string with the changed content and assign the variable to point to it. This is true despite the fact you can get value at the index of the string `s[0]`

# Functions

A javascript function begins with `function name(){}`


# Slice

slice(0,i+1) - grab a slice of the array or string from 0 to ith index

# Built in sort() function

By default, the sort method sorts elements alphabetically. To sort numerically just add a new method which handles numeric sorts (sortNumber, shown below) `sortedCandies.sort(function(a,b) {return a - b});`

This function uses some variation of quicksort.
